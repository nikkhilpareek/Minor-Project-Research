# Title: Decentralized Carbon Markets: Blockchain-Enabled Carbon Credit Exchange

### Abstract:
The current offline carbon credit trading market
suffers from inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and limited ac-
cessibility, hindering its effectiveness in promoting sustainabil-
ity. Blockchain technology presents a promising solution that
enables secure, transparent, and decentralized trading. How-
ever, traditional blockchain models, particularly those based
on proof-of-work (PoW), are computationally intensive and
environmentally costly. This research explores a blockchain-
based framework for carbon credit trading that balances trans-
parency, efficiency, and sustainability. We investigate energy-
efficient consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS)
and layer-2 scaling solutions to reduce the environmental
footprint while maintaining security and trust. In addition,
we examine the integration of carbon neutral and renewable
energy-powered blockchain networks. Our proposed model
aims to improve the credibility and accessibility of carbon credit
markets while ensuring that the underlying technology aligns
with global environmental goals
