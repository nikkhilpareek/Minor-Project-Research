# Application of Blockchain Technology in Carbon Trading Market

## History of Carbon Credit System

### Origins and Foundations
- **Carbon Trading Concept**: A mechanism that regulates carbon dioxide emissions through carbon caps and taxation
- **Kyoto Protocol Impact**: Established in 1997, strengthened the trading system by allowing the exchange of carbon emission rights for financial compensation
- **Definition**: Carbon trading is the exchange of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rights for monetary rewards within a market framework aimed at reducing emissions

### Key Milestones and Development

#### Early Foundations (1990s)
- **1991**: European Union introduced carbon taxation mechanisms
- **1997**: United Nations established the Carbon Trading System (CTS) through the Kyoto Protocol

#### Expansion Period (2000-2009)
- **2001**: United States withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol
- **2002**: United Kingdom established its Emission Trading System (ETS)
- **2004**: Russia ratified the Kyoto Protocol, providing full legal implementation
- **2005**: European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) launched, becoming the world's largest ETS
- **2008**: New Zealand implemented its national ETS
- **2009**: Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) formed, covering emissions in northeastern US states

#### Global Adoption (2010-Present)
- **2010**: Japan introduced its ETS framework
- **2012**: South Korea launched comprehensive national ETS
- **2013**: China began regional carbon trading pilot programs
- **2019**: South Africa implemented carbon tax mechanisms
- **2021**: China established its national ETS, becoming the world's largest by volume

### Market Growth and Valuation

The global carbon market has experienced significant expansion since its inception:

#### Historical Growth
- **2005**: Initial market valuation of $10.9 billion
    - Established with approximately 8% annual growth rate

#### Current Status
- **2023**: Market value reached $95 billion
    - Representing nearly 9x growth from initial valuation

#### Future Projections
- **2030**: Expected to reach $100 billion
- **2050**: Projected expansion to $250 billion
    - Indicating continued long-term market maturation

## Current Implementation Status

### European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS)
- **System Status**: Currently in Phase 4 (2021-2030)
- **Coverage**: 
    - 10,000+ power plants and industrial facilities
    - Spans 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway
- **Operational Model**:
    - Allocates carbon credits to participating entities
    - Monitors emission rates against allocated allowances
    - Provides financial incentives for emission reductions
    - Imposes carbon tax on entities exceeding their allocations
    - Tax revenues fund environmentally friendly initiatives

### Global Carbon Trading Landscape
- **Active Systems**: 28 national and regional ETS schemes currently operational
- **Development Status**:
    - 8 nations in active development phase
    - 12 countries considering implementation
- **Regional Adoption**:
    - Limited implementation across African continent
    - Nigeria exploring potential carbon trading frameworks

## Existing Carbon Trading Systems

### Global Adoption and Distribution
- **System Proliferation**: Following the European Trading System (ETS), multiple national and regional systems have emerged
- **Geographic Spread**: 
    - Established in China, Mexico, France, Sweden, and other nations
    - Notable absence of systems across the African continent
- **Implementation Status**:
    - 28 national and regional ETSs fully operational
    - 8 nations in active development phase
    - 12 countries considering implementation
    - Nigeria is the only African country contemplating national ETS

### EU ETS Impact and Scale
- **Population vs. Emissions Ratio**: 
    - Comprises one-third of global population
    - Accounts for only 17% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions
- **Emission Reduction**: Achieved 20% reduction in emissions during 2020s compared to 1990s levels

### Working Principles and Challenges

#### Operational Framework
- **Core Mechanism**: Based on Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) of emission values

#### System Limitations
- **Transparency Issues**: 
    - Lack of trust and transparency in existing centralized systems
    - Questions regarding validity of reserved carbon credits
- **Structural Weaknesses**:
    - Increased risk of manipulation and fraud
    - Carbon leakage preventing accurate value accounting
    - Complex trading patterns
    - High transaction costs

#### Market Consequences
- **Participation Barriers**: Low engagement in incentivized trading system
- **Economic Impact**: 
    - Reduced market liquidity
    - Inappropriate price fixing mechanisms
