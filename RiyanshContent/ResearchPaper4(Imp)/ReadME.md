### Working Principles and Challenges

#### Operational Framework
- **Core Mechanism**: Based on Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) of emission values

#### System Limitations
- **Transparency Issues**: 
    - Lack of trust and transparency in existing centralized systems
    - Questions regarding validity of reserved carbon credits
- **Structural Weaknesses**:
    - Increased risk of manipulation and fraud
    - Carbon leakage preventing accurate value accounting
    - Complex trading patterns
    - High transaction costs

#### Market Consequences
- **Participation Barriers**: Low engagement in incentivized trading system
- **Economic Impact**: 
    - Reduced market liquidity
    - Inappropriate price fixing mechanisms

### Disadvantages of Existing Systems

- **Exclusion of Small Emitters**: The current carbon market design doesn't accommodate smaller emitters, as it's predominantly dominated by large entities. This exclusivity creates operational ambiguity, restricting participation and hindering competition and innovation among local initiatives.

- **Manual Reporting Flaws**: Reliance on manual emissions reporting introduces human error risks, potentially leading to inaccurate emission records. The absence of automated systems prevents real-time assessment of net-zero carbon targets and creates opportunities for data manipulation that compromises credibility.

- **Economic Burden Transfer**: Carbon taxes or quota purchase requirements increase production costs for emitting entities. Manufacturers must account for these added expenses alongside existing costs, typically passing the financial burden to end consumers through inflated product prices.

- **Fraudulent Activities**: The system suffers from integrity issues including recycling of certified emission reductions (CERs) and issuance of non-additional offset credits after transactions. These officially assigned credits lose their ability to provide additional emission reduction, rendering them redundant.

## Overview of Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology represents a revolutionary approach to data management and transaction processing that offers significant advantages for carbon trading systems.

### Characteristics of Blockchain Technology

- **Decentralization**: No central authority, thereby preventing single point of failure.

- **Transparency & Privacy**: All participating nodes can view information regarding transactions accessible to them without compromising the privacy of the contractual terms.

- **Data Security**: Blockchain offers encrypted security, ensuring transaction protection for both parties involved in the system, guaranteeing process integrity.

- **Smart Contracts**: Enable the system to operate autonomously, eliminating the need for third-party escrow. Once agreement terms are fulfilled, they trigger specific actions based on predefined conditions.

- **Safe and Reliable**: The distributed ledger ensures that each transaction among network participants is accurately recorded in a shared ledger. Since a consensus network is established, any issues within a transaction link can be directly identified and traced.

- **Efficiency and Convenience**: All network entities adhere to the same protocol, ensuring compliance with a shared consensus algorithm. Blockchain automatically validates transactions and continuously updates optimal trading routes and schedules based on historical data. Elimination of intermediaries simplifies and enhances network efficiency.

- **Inclusivity**: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can easily participate as blockchain doesn't impose size restrictions for market entry. This is crucial considering SMEs collectively have a more significant environmental impact than larger entities (e.g., in 2010, SMEs in China were responsible for 53% of the country's carbon emissions).

- **Distribution**: All participating nodes have a real-time copy of all updated records, eliminating single points of failure or vulnerability to attacks.

- **Traceability and Auditability**: Blockchain maintains a comprehensive historical record of all transactions and actions performed on subsequent blocks from inception.

- **Cost Reduction**: Blockchain-based systems enhance operational efficiency by reducing required human agents and execution time, lowering transaction costs and simplifying oversight and management for governmental and inspection agencies.

### Consensus Mechanisms

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: A consensus protocol commonly employed in distributed ledgers to validate nodes. It utilizes the Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256) to secure all network blocks. Its primary drawback is significant resource consumption, particularly electricity.

- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: The entity's stake in the system, specifically in terms of coin ownership, determines the possibility of creating or adding blocks. A notable vulnerability is the potential for instantaneous creation of multiple blocks on the chains.

- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Enables token holders to elect trustworthy delegates to represent their voting rights. More effective than PoW and PoS due to reduced energy requirements for transaction validation.

- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**: Named after the Byzantine General's decision puzzle. Employs hashes, digital signatures, and metadata in its consensus algorithm. Used by Hyperledger Fabric, it reduces system overhead and enhances execution speed while making hacking more challenging.

- **Delegated Proof of Reputation (DPoR)**: Enhances DPoS by improving system security. Voting power is calculated based on carbon reduction contributions of emitting enterprises. Higher reputation values grant greater influence, with reputations derived from voting outcomes and recent interactions.

- **Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA)**: Allows network entities to validate transactions approved by their trusted validators, relying on a minimal number of trustworthy validators chosen by network entities.

- **Proof of Authority (PoAu)**: Proposed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, it requires authorization of predetermined members to update information in the distributed ledger, adopting a more centralized approach for streamlined chain management.

- **Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)**: Validators set waiting periods for each entity across the network. Entities enter a dormant state and are reactivated in ascending order of their assigned waiting times.

- **Proof of Activity (PoA)**: Combines features of both PoW and PoS mechanisms. Blocks must undergo PoW verification followed by PoS verification before being added to the blockchain.

- **Proof of Burn (PoB)**: Entities must transfer specific amounts of coins to an escrow wallet to add blocks. Larger holdings increase the likelihood of successfully adding blocks, with deposited funds becoming permanently inaccessible.

- **Proof of Capacity (PoC)**: Utilizes available storage capacity of a disk, allowing entities to compile comprehensive lists of possible block hashes beforehand, reducing computational time.

- **Proof of Importance (PoI)**: Evaluates block significance based on transaction quality and the entity's reputation within the network before adding blocks to the blockchain.
