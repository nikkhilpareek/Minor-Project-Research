### Global Sustainability Goals
The 2015 Paris Agreement set in motion a concerted global effort to:
- Meet the sustainability goal of net-zero carbon emissions
- Limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius by 2050

As part of this agreement, countries have established:
- Regulations for carbon taxes
- Permissible carbon emissions limits for industries and companies

### Corporate Carbon Initiatives
Many organizations have committed to helping achieve carbon neutrality by 2050:

**Notable Examples:**
- **Arcelor Mittal's Carbâ„¢ Green Steel Certificates**
    - Equivalent to carbon credits linked to green projects
    - Allow customers to report equivalent reductions in Scope 3 emissions
    - Comply with the GHG Protocol standards
    
- **Toyota Material Handling Europe**
    - Moving towards a net-zero future
    - Implementing 100% renewable electricity

### Carbon Credits Explained
Individuals and companies can purchase carbon credits through:
- Over-the-counter transactions
- Voluntary carbon markets

**Carbon Credit Sources:**
Carbon credits are generated from various carbon reduction projects:
- Afforestation (planting new trees)
- Reforestation (preventing deforestation)
- Investment in renewable energy
