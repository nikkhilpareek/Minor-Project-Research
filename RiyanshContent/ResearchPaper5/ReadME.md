## Carbon Emissions Framework

The following framework provides a structured approach for calculating carbon emissions, rewards, and penalties based on electricity consumption. This system incentivizes consumers to reduce their electricity consumption and carbon footprint.

### Carbon Calculation Parameters

- **Emission Factor (EF)**: 0.6 kg CO2e per kWh
- **Reward System**: Monetary incentives for reduced consumption
- **Penalty System**: Charges applied for consumption exceeding 1000 kWh

### Consumption-to-Emissions Conversion Table

| Consumption Range (kWh) | Carbon Emissions (kg CO2e) | Reward (USD) | Penalty (USD) |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|---------------|

### Reward and Penalty System

#### Reward Structure
- Designed to encourage consumers to stay within lower consumption ranges
- Rewards increase linearly with consumption up to a threshold of 1000 kWh
- Promotes reduction of electricity usage
- Aligns economic incentives with environmental benefits

#### Penalty Structure
- Simple approach: consumption above 1000 kWh incurs a penalty of USD 2.00
- Acts as a deterrent against high electricity usage
- Encourages adoption of energy-saving measures

#### System Benefits
- Drives behavioral change toward more sustainable energy consumption
- Provides financial rewards for lower consumption
- Imposes penalties for excessive use
- Aligns individual economic incentives with broader environmental goals
